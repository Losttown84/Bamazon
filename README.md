I psuedo copy of Amazon, but lighter and for rookie coders!

Utilizing node and MySQL, create an "online store" for users to shop that will have items for sale, along with the products, prices and stock of each item.

Users can ask for the product, the the store will check if we have it in stock and if not, a message will be given. If there is stock available, an udpate will be made the MySQL database.
